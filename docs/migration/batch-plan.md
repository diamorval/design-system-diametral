# The batch execution plan

Resolution artifact for [The batch execution plan](https://github.com/diamorval/design-system-diametral/issues/167), the final ticket on [Absorb @diametral/ui into the official Diametral design system](https://github.com/diamorval/design-system-diametral/issues/151). Consumes [`inventory.md`](./inventory.md), [`react-ledger.md`](./react-ledger.md) and [`css-ledger.md`](./css-ledger.md).

Measured 2026-08-30 against source `packages/ui` @ `feat/css-conversion` (9182a91) and target `/Users/augustinmorval/code/design-system` @ `feat/components-migration` (23a0198, v0.11.0).

**This document is the map's destination.** When it exists and needs no further decisions, the map is done and execution is handed off.

## Headline

**89 components absorb, in 8 batches of ~2,050 landing LOC each, ordered risk-ascending, behind a batch 0 that publishes nothing.**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| absorbed components | **89** (40 admit outright − `stat-card` flip, 45 source wins, 4 CSS-only) |
| landing LOC (tsx + css) | **16,402** |
| never absorbed | **30** components, 9,091 LOC — the incumbent holds |
| batches | **8**, `1.0.0-beta.1` … `1.0.0-beta.8`, then `1.0.0` |
| batch 0 | infrastructure + everything touching only held or global surfaces. **No beta.** |
| new npm dependencies | **3** — `@dnd-kit/core`, `/sortable`, `/utilities`, in batch 8 |

`stat-card` flips to *incumbent holds* (§1.1), so the ledger headline moves from 40/46/29/4 to **40/45/30/4**.

---

## 1. The four decisions this ticket owed

### 1.1 `stat-card` holds — §6.1 of the CSS ledger confirmed

[#166](https://github.com/diamorval/design-system-diametral/issues/166) ruled it *source wins* on the stated reason "incumbent is a class-applier". It is not:

```js
StatCard.js:16   const [shown, setShown] = useState(value);
StatCard.js:17   useEffect(() => { ... requestAnimationFrame ... });
StatCard.js:33   return () => cancelAnimationFrame(raf);
```

`StatCard.js` (61 LOC) runs a count-up tween; the source's `stat-card.tsx` (88 LOC) has zero hooks. Rule 3's premise fails and rule 4's fails too — the source is a regression here, not a superset. **`stat-card` is incumbent holds and `stat-card.css` is held.** The CSS ledger already recorded it conservatively; this makes it final.

### 1.2 The chart merge folds two target files into one

Target `bar-chart.css` (106 L) + `charts.css` (275 L) are both replaced wholesale; the source has one `chart.css` (178 L). Neither target file is externally read, so neither name is a contract. **Both are deleted and the source's single `chart.css` lands.** Splitting the source to preserve a target file split that nothing depends on would be pure ceremony.

### 1.3 `form-controls.css` becomes seven files plus a radio remnant

Six of its seven React readers go to the source, `Radio`/`RadioGroup` holds. **The six leave as their source-named files** — `checkbox.css`, `checkbox-group.css`, `input.css`, `input-group.css`, `select.css`, `slider.css`, `textarea.css` — and `form-controls.css` stays, holding only the radio block.

Three reasons, none of them taste: [#157](https://github.com/diamorval/design-system-diametral/issues/157)'s C2 makes flat kebab and source file granularity the go-forward shape; the six replacements arrive as seven distinct source stylesheets already, so keeping one file means merging them back by hand; and shrinking `form-controls.css` to the radio block makes its one held reader visible instead of buried in 315 lines. The file is not externally read, so no contract moves. This closes the ledger's only *split* row.

### 1.4 The charte-conformance list is batch 0, not per-component

The map's other open fog patch. Measurement dissolves the "own batch vs folded per-component" question, because **most of its edits land on components no absorption batch ever touches**.

The red-strip splits three ways across the target's 20 red files:

| where | files | cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **replaced wholesale** — `charts`, `bar-chart`, `progress`, `kanban`, `stepper`, `spinner`, `sparkline` | 7 | **free** — the red leaves with the file |
| **held** — `vertical-nav`, `tabs`, `date-picker`, `rating`, `toast`, `calendar-view`, `datagrid`, `file-upload`, `motion`, `tree`, `date-range` | 11 | **real, and unattached to any batch** |
| **frozen, charte-sanctioned** — `grid.css` keeps its red lines ([#160](https://github.com/diamorval/design-system-diametral/issues/160)); `badge.css` strips | 2 | batch 7 for `badge` |

So the eleven held files are edits that belong to nothing else, conflict with nothing, and should land once and early. **They go in batch 0.3**, together with the global token and slot-layer work. Only Lucide→Phosphor rides a component batch, and it is narrower than assumed — **8 files**, concentrated in `react/components/icons.js`, `Icon.js`, their `.d.ts`, `components/ds-icon.js`, `examples/components/icons.html`, `css/components/icon.css` and `docs/for-claude.md` — so it rides **batch 7** with `icon`, whose `icon.css` is frozen.

---

## 2. The ordering rule

**Risk-ascending, family clusters whole, dependency overrides tier.**

A component's tier is the highest-risk CSS operation it performs:

| tier | operation | why it is riskier than the one above |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1 add** | its CSS lands in a namespace the target does not define | nothing can collide; nothing existing changes |
| **T2 replace** | it replaces an uncoupled target stylesheet wholesale | an in-repo surface may read the old classes |
| **T3 absorb** | it merges into a frozen external contract | class names are fixed by a published surface |
| **T4 swap** | it carries a behavioural change and owes a regress spec | correctness, not just cascade |

Two overrides, applied in this order:

1. **Dependency beats tier.** `combo-chart.tsx:16` imports `ChartContainer`/`ChartLegend`/`ChartTooltip` from `./chart.js`, so the eight net-new charts cannot land before the `chart` primitive — which is T2, because its stylesheet replaces two target files. The whole chart family therefore sits at the T1/T2 boundary as batches 4 and 5.
2. **Family clusters stay whole within a tier**, so no batch splits the overlay family (where 7 of the 18 `z-index: 50` rules concentrate) or the form-control family.

**Why this order and not the reverse.** A net-new component adds classes nothing already reads, so beta.1 is the artifact that *cannot* break an installed consumer. Under [#159](https://github.com/diamorval/design-system-diametral/issues/159) a batch that fails its gate is a stalled release, and the earliest batches are the ones with the least experience behind them. Risk-ascending puts the cheapest, safest work where the process is least proven.

**Re-cutting.** The rule above regenerates the sequence from the ledgers. A batch may be re-cut at any time by re-applying it; the cluster constraints in §4 are the only hard boundaries.

### Why sizing is by landing LOC

Component count is a bad proxy — `sidebar` is 674 LOC against `separator`'s 39 — and the CSS ledger showed the workload has *inverted*: additions are 38 files and ~2,890 LOC against 20 replacements. "Verifiable together" is not a constraint either: [#163](https://github.com/diamorval/design-system-diametral/issues/163)'s gate derives its routes from `registry.ts`, so gate scope is free at any granularity and can be route-filtered per batch. That leaves landing LOC — tsx + css of what actually moves — as the only measure that tracks session cost. **~2,050 LOC per batch** keeps a batch inside one ~100K session with room for the gate run and the `renames.json` capture.

---

## 3. Batch 0 — infrastructure. No beta.

Batch 0 publishes nothing. Its rule: **everything that touches only held or global surfaces**, so no absorption batch can conflict with it. Three sequential work items, no beta between them; their content ships with `beta.1`.

The dist-tag is deliberately left unexercised until `beta.1` carries real content. `publish-npm.yml` fires today on any `v*` tag with a bare `npm publish`, so nothing may be tagged before 0.1 lands.

### 0.1 — Release and verification plumbing

- Cut the long-lived **`v1` branch**; `main` stays at 0.11.0 so the gh-pages docs never advertise a system `latest` cannot install (#159 R12).
- **`publish-npm.yml` learns a dist-tag** — `next` for prereleases. Required *before* beta 1 (#159).
- **Port the source's `package` CI job** (#163 V9), with a component-class assertion, not just a token grep — the omission that let #154's dangling `@import`s ship. Brings the target the commercial-font tarball assertion it entirely lacks: Ufficio is kept out of the tarball by `.npmignore` alone.
- Add **#155's two CI checks**, release-blocking: every `ds-*` class a component renders resolves to a defined selector, and the non-React layers import nothing.
- Add the **`@layer utilities` CI check** (#157 C3) so every later batch is forced to strip on the way in.
- **Arm `a11y.yml`** (#163 V3) — the REPORT-ONLY header is false on both halves: both repos independently ship `--ds-ink-faint: #6c6f7d`, so nothing diverged from `tokens.json`.
- Add **`web-components.html`** to the target's a11y spec (#163 V7) — it is the only page exercising the 11 web components and is in neither suite today.
- **Un-hardcode `kanban-regress.spec.ts:50`** (it pins `localhost:5173`, the dev server, so it cannot run under the configured `webServer`) and add a **`test:regress` script**; neither regress spec is wired to any workflow.
- Set an **explicit CI worker count and a per-test timeout above 30 s** (#163 V11) — the 8 failures in the 240-test run were all load timeouts, not axe violations.
- **Extract `docs/migration/variants.json`** from the design-sync cache — 259 cells, 234 domain-authored notes — then **delete the cache** (#163 V6).
- **Establish the tsc-only build** (#155): one authoring model, everything TSX, `.d.ts` generated, the source's proven pipeline ported. The target's first compile step for any surface.
- **Demote `./react/*`** so the barrel is the only supported React entry (#159 amendment) — this is the free window that permanently kills #158's PascalCase collision defect and lets every batch author kebab.
- Docs debt: delete `versioning.md`'s pre-1.0 blocker paragraph (cleared by #161), delete the three stale runbook blocks in `RELEASE.md` and `docs/installation.md` (the dual-registry claim was wrong), and write the **ADR naming Base UI as a substrate** (#155).
- Scaffold **`docs/migration/renames.json`** empty, plus the generators that read it for the migration guide and CHANGELOG.

### 0.2 — `site/`

[#163](https://github.com/diamorval/design-system-diametral/issues/163)'s gate **is** the docs app, so the harness must exist before batch 1 can be verified. #163's V10 makes `site/` load-bearing for the release: it can never be dropped, left broken, or excluded from CI.

The eight-step move from #158, plus two:

1. Copy `apps/web` in as **`site/`** — a nested directory with its own lockfile, deliberately **not** a workspace member, so its ~15 devDeps never leak into the zero-dep package's resolution graph (D1).
2. Vite `base`, router `basename`, `404.html` SPA fallback; deployed by the existing `pages.yml` on push to `main` (D2).
3. Install the package **`file:..`** (D3) — npm symlinks it, so imports resolve through the real `exports` map against working-tree files, catching the broken-exports-map class a Vite alias hides.
4. Repoint the `demo-source` plugin's source path — it needs TSX source, not the emit.
5. Rewrite the **1,109 deep imports across 576 tsx** to the barrel (forced by 0.1's `./react/*` demotion).
6. Swap the stylesheet entry to `dist/diametral.css` (#157 C9 — one deliverable, not two).
7. Local chrome CSS in the app, redefining the ~10 shadcn slot names 0.3 deletes (D6). Tailwind stays inside the docs app; CSS-1 forbids it as a *consumer* requirement, which a docs app is not.
8. Delete `showcase.tsx` (54.7 K) (D8); copy the `components-page` skill in (D7). `examples/` travels verbatim — it is the only committed fixture the visual and a11y suites have.
9. **Seed `registry.ts` with the 30 held target components.** Without this they are never gate-covered, since the registry is what generates routes (#163 V2) — they ship in 1.0.0 and would otherwise be the only untested part of it.
10. Wire the **`docs/components.md` generator** off the same `registry.ts` (D5), so drift is structurally impossible.

It is a **PR check, never a release gate** as a deliverable (D4); the components it renders are release-gated (V10).

### 0.3 — Global CSS and the charte-conformance list

Everything here touches held or global surfaces only.

- **Delete the shadcn slot layer** (#157 C5). Rewriting its 32 unprefixed globals to `--ds-*` removes an indirection tier and kills a live `--accent`/`--card` conflict with `legacy-aliases.css`. `versioning.md` scopes the API to `--ds-*`, so this is not a contract break and owes no deprecation.
- In the same edit, `--primary: var(--ds-accent)` → `var(--ds-action)` (`globals.css:317`). **One line executes #160's red-strip across the source's 20 red surfaces.**
- **`--ds-vert` / `--ds-green-brand` → `#53ff64`** in the target's `css/tokens.css` and `tokens/tokens.json`, and the source's `globals.css`. #161 confirmed the value four times against the live Confluence page; the "known typo" comment in both repos is itself the error and is deleted.
- **Strip red defaults from the 11 held CSS files** listed in §1.4. Move chart and sparkline series to `--ds-chart-*`. `grid.css` keeps its red lines.
- Correct the two prose assertions #158 found: `llms.txt` hard-codes `accent #ff2a00`, and `docs/for-claude.md` restates the rule. Both false under #160.
- **The five in-place a11y fixes** (#166), each with a `<component>-regress.spec.ts` under #163 V4. All five are on held components, so they conflict with no absorption batch:

  | file | fix | size |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `RadioGroup.js` | default `name` to `React.useId()` — without it the radios are not one group and the **native** arrow keys silently stop working | 2 LOC |
  | `ColorPicker.js` | arrow keys across the swatch group | ~25 LOC |
  | `Calendar.js` | arrow-key navigation on the existing grid skeleton, then compose `DatePicker`/`DateRangePicker` onto it — the #164 cluster: three files, one behavioural change, **fixes three defects while deleting code** | ~30 LOC + the two pickers |
  | `Tree.js` | Up/Down/Left/Right/Home/End + roving `tabIndex` (it is `tabIndex: 0` on every item today, `Tree.js:55`) | ~35 LOC |
  | `DataGrid.js` | `role="grid"`/`row`/`gridcell` + roving cell focus, over the real `<table>`; must not collide with the edit handler at `:217` | ~70 LOC |

  Also resolve `Calendar.js`'s own contradiction — it comments that *"`aria-selected` is allowed on gridcell (`aria-pressed` is not)"* while `DatePicker.js` does exactly that.

---

## 4. The eight batches

Each batch: absorbs its components, adds them to `registry.ts`, strips `@layer utilities` from every source stylesheet it lands, emits its removed→replacement rows to `docs/migration/renames.json`, rewrites the hand-written docs pages teaching its classes, runs the gate route-filtered to its own routes, then publishes `1.0.0-beta.N` on `next`.

### Batch 1 — net-new overlays and menus · beta.1 · 6 comp · 2,031 LOC

`context-menu` 525 · `navigation-menu` 426 · `menubar` 370 · `autocomplete` 370 · `speed-dial` 214 · `hover-card` 126

All six land in a **clean namespace** — `ds-context-menu`, `ds-menubar` and the rest match zero selectors in the target's `css/`. Three arrived through #166's A4 alias withdrawals; `context-menu` is the one that would have quietly dropped right-click menus from the system.

Carries **7 of the 18 `z-index: 50` remaps** (`context-menu` 2, `hover-card` 2, `autocomplete` 1, `navigation-menu` 1, `speed-dial` 1) — the overlay family is where they concentrate.

**Re-wiring obligation:** `menubar` imports the source's `dropdown-menu`, which holds. Re-compose onto the target's `Dropdown`/`MenuItem`.

### Batch 2 — net-new content and media · beta.2 · 14 comp · 2,345 LOC

`attachment` 404 · `item` 365 · `bubble` 316 · `theme-switcher` 217 · `message-scroller` 216 · `message` 148 · `marker` 135 · `toc` 131 · `resizable` 102 · `scroll-area` 92 · `qr-code` 90 · `snippet` 67 · `masonry` 34 · `aspect-ratio` 28

`message-scroller` and `resizable` are **admit-CSS-only** — their stylesheets ship, their React bindings do not, so real landing LOC here is ~2,197. `@shadcn/react` and `react-resizable-panels` are not acquired.

**Re-wiring:** `theme-switcher` imports held `dropdown-menu` and `toggle-group` → re-compose onto `Dropdown`/`MenuItem` and `Segmented`. `snippet` imports held `code-block` → re-compose onto the target's `CodeBlock`.

### Batch 3 — net-new form controls and primitives · beta.3 · 16 comp · 1,839 LOC

`carousel` 303 · `relative-time` 179 · `input-otp` 171 · `editable` 169 · `phone-input` 157 · `button-group` 157 · `meter` 156 · `toggle` 138 · `field-array` 134 · `wordmark` 98 · `label` 53 · `separator` 39 · `icon-button` 37 · `form` 25 · `collapsible` 19 · `direction` 4

`carousel` and `input-otp` are **admit-CSS-only** (~1,668 real). `embla-carousel-react` and `input-otp` are not acquired. `meter`, `form` and `toggle` are A4 withdrawals landing clean; `label` and `separator` are partials admitting outright. `button-group`, `icon-button` and `wordmark` replace applier symbols but have **no target stylesheet at all**, so their CSS is an addition.

Carries **`phone-input.tsx`'s Tailwind literals** — one of the two files left of #157's "~180 across 33", the rest absorbed by `feat/css-conversion`.

### Batch 4 — chart substrate and replacement charts · beta.4 · 9 comp · 1,591 LOC

`chart` 532 · `donut-chart` 172 · `bar-chart` 155 · `sparkline` 151 · `gauge` 148 · `stacked-bar` 135 · `line-chart` 108 · `area-chart` 100 · `pie-chart` 90

**The tier inversion.** `chart` is T2 — its stylesheet replaces two target files — but it is the substrate of every chart in batches 4 and 5, so it comes first.

Carries **the chart merge** (§1.2): target `bar-chart.css` + `charts.css` deleted, source `chart.css` lands. Red leaves with those files, free. `sparkline`'s series move to `--ds-chart-*`.

Carries **`playwright.config.js:51`'s phantom reference** — it cites `tests/chart-marks.spec.ts`, which does not exist, and claims chart animation *"still has one gate that runs it for real"*. Write it or delete the comment; this is the batch that knows.

### Batch 5 — net-new charts · beta.5 · 8 comp · 1,889 LOC

`heatmap` 446 · `waterfall-chart` 286 · `bullet-chart` 242 · `funnel-chart` 211 · `treemap` 200 · `scatter-chart` 189 · `combo-chart` 184 · `radar-chart` 131

All eight compose batch 4's `ChartContainer`/`ChartLegend`/`ChartTooltip` and land in clean namespace. `recharts` is substrate, already paid.

### Batch 6 — wholesale replacements · beta.6 · 15 comp · 2,464 LOC

`stepper` 228 · `timeline` 227 · `avatar` 226 · `pagination` 223 · `agenda` 205 · `table` 185 · `breadcrumb` 180 · `empty` 178 · `toolbar` 164 · `banner` 160 · `progress` 155 · `page-header` 146 · `description-list` 76 · `kbd` 74 · `spinner` 37

The remaining 13 of the 20 wholesale-replaced stylesheets, plus two **cross-boundary pins**:

- **`stepper`** — its React goes to the source, but `stepper.css` is **held**: `Wizard` (held) renders the entire `.ds-stepper__marker`/`__label`/`__step` block. The source `Stepper` must render the target's classes. **Verify `Wizard` still renders before the gate.**
- **`table`** — no React component on either side; `table.css` replaces on its own.

Red leaves `progress`, `stepper` and `spinner` free.

**One look owed** (#165 §6.2): `agenda` and `pagination` are ruled *source wins* on "incumbent is a class-applier", but both incumbents carry real derived logic — `Agenda` groups and sorts through a `useMemo`, `Pagination` computes windows through `range()`/`go()`. Whether the source is a strict superset needs reading, not measuring. If either turns out not to be, it holds and its stylesheet holds with it.

### Batch 7 — frozen contracts and the form-controls split · beta.7 · 16 comp · 2,715 LOC

`field` 425 · `select` 409 · `input-group` 345 · `button` 307 · `card` 175 · `badge` 147 · `panel` 136 · `slider` 128 · `status` 125 · `switch` 118 · `checkbox` 91 · `textarea` 85 · `tag` 82 · `input` 68 · `icon` 43 · `checkbox-group` 31

The highest-care batch: every class name here is fixed by a surface outside the package. Source CSS is absorbed **into** the existing contract — renamed into the frozen grammar, not replacing it.

**Frozen readers** (#165 §1): `<ds-badge>`, `<ds-button>`, `<ds-callout>`, `<ds-icon>`, `<ds-modal>`, `<ds-panel>`, `<ds-section-heading>`, `<ds-segmented>`, `<ds-status>`, `<ds-switch>`, `<ds-tabs>` — 17 literal classes across 16 files — plus Streamlit consumers reading `ds-card`, `ds-statgrid`, `ds-tag`, `ds-tag--success`, `ds-title`, `ds-title--xl` from **published `docs/streamlit.md`**. Four families are **dynamic** (`ds-badge--`, `ds-button--`, `ds-callout--`, `ds-status--` are string-concatenated from a pass-through attribute), so the whole modifier family is frozen, not just the literal name.

Carries:
- **The `form-controls.css` seven-way split** (§1.3) — six readers out to source-named files, the radio block stays.
- **`.ds-input`'s four-way dedupe** — defined in `field.css` (canonical, frozen) plus `color-picker.css`, `combobox.css` and `time-picker.css`, resolved silently by load order today. All four files are frozen or held, so it is safe here and nowhere earlier.
- **`ds-open` and `ds-close`** — set by `ds-modal.js`, matched by no rule in `css/`. Dead classes in a frozen surface: implement or delete from the web component.
- **Lucide → Phosphor**, 8 files (§1.4), with `icon`.
- **`badge.css`'s red strip.**
- **2 of the 18 `z-index: 50` remaps** (`select`).

### Batch 8 — defect swaps · beta.8 · 5 comp · 1,528 LOC

`drawer` 550 · `kanban` 466 · `sheet` 292 · `tooltip` 195 · `skeleton` 25

The only batch that buys a dependency and the only one that changes behaviour on a contested component. Three swaps, each earned on a measured defect and each owing a `<component>-regress.spec.ts`:

| swap | the incumbent's defect |
| --- | --- |
| `tooltip` | `Tooltip.js` (42 LOC) renders `role="tooltip"` on a **sibling span with no `id` and no `aria-describedby` on the trigger**, so a screen reader never announces it; no Escape dismissal |
| `drawer` + `sheet` | `Drawer.js` (52 LOC) has Escape and `role=dialog`/`aria-modal` but **no focus trap and no portal** — and nothing in the target implements one to copy; `Modal` has the same gap. Two source components merge onto the target's one `Drawer` symbol: **this merge must land whole** |
| `kanban` | 49 LOC of HTML5 drag with **zero ARIA and no keyboard path at all**. Accessible DnD is a lift/move/drop state machine with live regions, not an `onKeyDown`. Arrives with **five committed Playwright tests, three of them keyboard** |

**`@dnd-kit/core` + `/sortable` + `/utilities` — the migration's entire new dependency bill**, for `kanban` alone.

Also carries:
- **`skeleton`** — React to the source, but `skeleton.css` is **held**: `DataGrid` renders `.ds-skeleton--text` for its loading rows. Same cross-boundary pin as `stepper`. **Verify `DataGrid`'s loading state before the gate.**
- **9 of the 18 `z-index: 50` remaps** (`drawer` 3, `sheet` 2, `tooltip` 4).
- **`sidebar`'s two cherry-picks** (#164 A3) — cookie-persisted collapse and `Cmd+B` onto `AppShell`. The other 23 composition parts do not port. Whatever of `sidebar.tsx`'s Tailwind literals the cherry-picks carry finishes #157's C7.
- **Re-class `examples/components/kanban.html`, `examples/demo/views/talent.js`, `examples/demo/views/work.js`** to flat kebab.
- **Generate the visual baselines**, on Linux, **at the last batch only** (#163 V5) — during absorption the pixels change by design, so a diff before this point flags the work. `visual.yml`'s `update_baselines` input and skip-when-absent step were built for exactly this.

---

## 5. Cutover to `1.0.0`

After batch 8 is green:

1. Full gate over all 119 routes × 2 themes, unfiltered, tiers 1–4 (a11y, keyboard, contract, integration). Tier 5 (visual) arms **after** 1.0.0.
2. **Assert `registry.ts` length equals the shipped component count** — 89 absorbed + 30 held. A component missing from the registry is invisible to the gate and to `docs/components.md`.
3. React 18 compile, **release-blocking** (#155) — the peer holds at `>= 18` and the source's `>=19` was never verified.
4. Generate the migration guide and CHANGELOG from the accumulated `docs/migration/renames.json`.
5. Merge `v1` to `main`, tag `v1.0.0`, publish to `latest`. **`latest` moves exactly once**, so every break lands inside one version — the clean break #159 chose, with no shim; `legacy-aliases.css` stays the sole alias file.
6. `pages.yml` deploys the docs site on that merge — the first moment the public docs describe a system `latest` can install.

Retirement of `@diametral/ui` is a **no-op**: it was never published to npm (404), so #154's dangling-`@import` defect needs no shipped fix and there is no installed base to shim for.

---

## 6. Cluster integrity — the hard boundaries

A re-cut may move anything except these. Each is a single behavioural or structural change that a batch boundary would break in half.

| cluster | why it cannot split |
| --- | --- |
| `chart` before the 8 net-new charts | `combo-chart.tsx:16` and kin import `./chart.js` |
| `drawer` + `sheet` | two source components onto one target `Drawer` symbol, one swap |
| `bar-chart.css` + `charts.css` ← `chart.css` | a merge; a half-merge leaves an orphan stylesheet |
| the `form-controls` seven-way split | one file's readers disagree; splitting the split unstyles someone |
| `Calendar` + `DatePicker` + `DateRangePicker` | one behavioural change across three files (batch 0.3) |
| `stepper` with `Wizard`, `skeleton` with `DataGrid` | cross-boundary pins — whoever moves the React must verify the held component still renders |

## 8. What this plan does not decide

Nothing on the route. Three items are deliberately left to the batch that has the evidence:

1. **`agenda` and `pagination`** (#165 §6.2) — read them in batch 6; if either incumbent is not an applier, it holds, exactly as `stat-card` did.
2. **`ds-open` / `ds-close`** — implement or delete, in batch 7, by whoever reads `ds-modal.js`.
3. **`tests/chart-marks.spec.ts`** — write it or delete the comment, in batch 4.

Each is a one-line call by the executing agent, not a decision the map owes. **The way to the destination is clear.**
