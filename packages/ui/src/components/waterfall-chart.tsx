//
// A bar chart shows the deltas but hides the running total; a line shows the
// total but hides what moved it. This shows both, as two stacked bars per row —
// a transparent one carrying the running base, and the visible delta floating on
// top of it.
//
//   `totalKeys`   ->  rows that restate the total rather than move it. Without
//                      it the closing bar stacks on the running figure and
//                      floats at roughly twice its true height
//   `connectors`  ->  the ticks joining one bar's edge to the next bar's base.
//                      They are what makes a waterfall read as a waterfall
//
// Colour is semantic, not a series ramp: rises take `--ds-success`, falls
// `--ds-danger`, totals a neutral ramp slot. That is `BarChart`'s `statusKey`
// axis reused rather than a second vocabulary — but per-row through `Cell`, not
// through the row's `fill`, which recharts would apply to the transparent base
// bar as well.
//
// The running total is assumed to stay at or above zero. A sequence that crosses
// into negative territory would need a base below the axis, which a stack cannot
// express — split it into two charts instead.
